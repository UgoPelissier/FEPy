# FEPy - Finite Element (Python)

Python project to build the Delaunay triangulation of 2D points and solve the Poisson and convection-diffusion equations in different study cases (Cavity and Oven).

Oven study case is inspired from a study case proposed during a class, which was initially solved using the open-source PDE solver *FreeFem++*.

The utlimate goal was to implement from scratch both a mesher and a PDE solver that could be used for this case. Along the way, additional features were developped such as time-dependant calculations and adaptive meshing.

## Mesh

Delaunay triangulation
- Unstructured
- Constrained
- Maximum mesh size
- Minimum angle of 20Â°
